clone from https://github.com/cm12-amami/android_platform_external_libnl.git

Background:
Need 'iw' tool in android, so libnl is essential.
Found libnl.so and libnetlink.so in HTC 11plus and Redmi K30. So have to try libnl-2.0.
Finally use NDK build the libnl.a but got the below error message. Android prohibits user to use netlink in an unlocked device.
"Failed to connect to generic netlink."

Notice:
1. use APP_PLATFORM=android-21
2. build static library only.
